# Nixie-LOG-January2023

<pre>

<b>01-Jun-2023</b>  Started to write documents about the project

<b>02-Jun-2023</b>  Started to take technical notes. Created a file system

<b>12-Jun-2023</b>  NixiePanel PCB is arrived. ESP32-S3-Mini is arrived

<b>15-Jun-2023</b>  ESP32-S3-Mini is not really easy to use :/ I think there are some missing and/or buggy codes on the
             bootloader feature in the current library. Although I could download some simple codes, I cannot 
             download them again without entering the factory-boot-mode
